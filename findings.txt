According to my understanding, the conatiners shares with the host the following things:

- Kernel
- Network
- File system
- Processes

Here, containers work on using host's kernel. It helps them run without having a whole OS, which makes them lightwight.
While sharing the host's network containers can communicate within and outside. Even though
containers have their own filesystem, they have the ability to access the host's filesystem
for things such as disk space etc. Host is able to see on what processes are the containers running on,
while having their own processes. The containers run in isolation along with having access to certain things
of the provided host.
